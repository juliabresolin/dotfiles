# Dotfiles

This Repository Dotfiles contain my personal config files. Here you'll find configs, customizations, themes, and whatever I need to personalize my mac OS experience.

## Fonts and Icons
To display icons in terminal or applications Fonts, I'm using <a href='https://www.nerdfonts.com/'>Nerd Fonts</a>. I'm currently using the Hack Nerd Font Mono in terminal applications, and JetBrains Mono Nerd Font in applications.
